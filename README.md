# Usage

The app is meant to be connected to a server using `TCP\IP`


The default connection settings are `ip = 127.0.0.1, port = 5402`, and can be changed using the `Settings` button.

## Using the controls

The main controls are two sliders and a joystick.

The two sliders, controlling aileron and throttle as can be seen, are set by sliding them to the desired value and thus setting it to said value in the simulator.

The joystick acts the same with rudder on the X axis and elevator on the Y. The values are set by moving the joystick knob to the desired value.
